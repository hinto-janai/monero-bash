		# P2Pool allowing miner connections during sync causes fake stats
		# ---------------------------------------------------------------
		# If you have miners already pointed at p2pool while it's syncing,
		# it will send jobs to those miners, even though it's still syncing.
		# These jobs aren't "fake" but they do cause distorted stats.
		# (e.g.: SHARE FOUND message on a non-mainchain job).
		#
		# P2Pool doesn't ignore the old jobs even AFTER SYNCING.
		# So if you get unlucky and P2Pool gets a share within the same
		# milliseconds as syncing (which is easy since you're the only
		# miner on your personal chain, and almost guaranteed when there's
		# network latency involved), you'll get something like this:
		#
		# 2022-08-14 15:58:09.2753 SideChain SYNCHRONIZED           <--- okay, we're synced? time to parse from here!
		# 2022-08-14 15:58:09.3276 SHARE FOUND: mainchain ...       <--- wow, we found a share within 0.05 seconds!
	    # 2022-08-14 15:58:09.3315 SHARE FOUND: mainchain ...            these have to be real shares we found since
		#                                                                we synced already, right...? RIGHT SCHERNYKH...!?
		#
		# How am I supposed to know if these shares are "real" or not?
		# They are after the "SYNCHRONIZED" message but they aren't real.
		# P2Pool doesn't discard these shares after syncing, so when you type
		# in 'status', it'll show you are synced with the mainchain, and that
		# you found 2 shares (but not that those 2 aren't mainchain shares!):
		#
		# Side chain ID             = default           <-- you are synced with the main-chain
		# Side chain height         = 2xxxxxx
		# Side chain hashrate       = 1xx.xxx MH/s
		# Your shares position      = [2.........]      <-- these were found before you synced
		# Shares found              = 2                     but p2pool doesn't tell you that
		#
		# Technically these shares aren't "fake", they can be real Monero hashes,
		# but they probably shouldn't be lumped together with the mainchain stats.
		#
		# After p2pool syncs, it'll start sending "real" mainchain jobs to
		# the miners so this issue is only prevalent before being synced,
		# and for a few seconds after the inital sync (old jobs coming in)
		#
		# Some others mentioning this "bug":
		#     - https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool/issues/154
		#     - https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool/issues/185
		#
		# SChernykh's reply:
		#     - "It's a rare situation for such computer to even
		#        find a share, let alone find it at the exact time
		#        p2pool gets synchronized and resets counters."
		#
		# But Mr.Chernykh... this happens every time I start p2pool :)
		#
		# The fake share parsing fix:
		#     1. Parse the time of the SYNCHRONIZED msg
		#     2. Get the NEXT second after that initial time
		#     3. Account for any time overflows (23:59:59 -> 00:00:00)
		#     4. Delete any lines that contain those (2 second) timestamps
		#
		# 2 seconds should be a big enough margin to delete the fake shares,
		# and small enough to not clobber any real shares found.
		#
		# $SYNC_TIME   = sync timestamp
		# $SYNC_TIME_2 = 1 second after

		# Update: 2022-08-15
		# ------------------
		# I assumed P2Pool's local API would show the same
		# "fake" data as well so I didn't bother to check
		# but it seems like it only counts mainchain shares.
		# For some reason the API gets a different feed of
		# data than the console 'status' does. Anyway, I'll just
		# take 'shares_found' from there because it's better than
		# whatever the hell I wrote below. It also has other stats
		# I could include I guess (hashrate, effort, connections)

		# Update: 2022-08-15 10 minutes later
		# -----------------------------------
		# I lied. The API data also gets distorted by the
		# sub-second "fake" shares coming in at sync time.
		# Looks like we're using this code after all.
		# Note: We can also reset the EFFORT % with this
		# accurate share data, if shares found = 0, then
		# average_effort MUST also be 0.
		# I'll keep the API data around if the user set
		# the LOG_LEVEL = 0, then we can supply at least
		# SOME amount of information (even if it's inaccurate)

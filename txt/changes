# PACKAGE | monero-bash
# VERSION | v2.0.0
# RELEASE | 2022
#
# v2.0.0
## Updates
**This is a major version update and is NOT COMPATIBLE with previous `v1.x.x` versions.**  
**To upgrade properly: `monero-bash uninstall` and reinstall this version.**

* **File changes**
	***All `monero-bash` files are now installed in `$HOME/.monero-bash`***
	```
	$HOME/.monero-bash/
	  ├─ changes
	  ├─ config
	  ├─ wallets
	  ├─ packages
	```
* **New commands**
	```
	monero-bash new <wallet type>          | Enter wallet creation mode
	monero-bash changes <packages>         | Read changelogs of packages
	monero-bash config <packages>          | Enter interactive config mode for packages
	monero-bash refresh <packages>         | Refresh your systemd file to match your config
	monero-bash enable/disable <processes> | Enable/disable auto-start on computer boot for processes
	```
* **Package manager**
	- ***Now multi-threaded, up to 4x faster. List of multi-threaded processes:***
		- Package metadata fetch
		- Download of hash file, signature file, and tar file
		- Verification of tar hash & PGP signature
	- ***Changelog creation***
		- A changelog file is now installed during package install/upgrade and can viewed with: `monero-bash changes <packages>`
	- ***Lock***
		- Lock files are now created, prevents multiple instances of `monero-bash` updates/upgrades/installs
* **P2Pool**
	- `monero-bash` now installs a `p2pool.conf` along with `P2Pool`. It allows P2Pool behavior changes via config file.

* **Security**
	- `monero-bash` user is created during initial installation. Monero and P2Pool run as this user. XMRig defaults to ROOT, can be configured in `monero-bash.conf`
	- Wallet passwords stored in memory are now encrypted with a one-time 4096-bit key using GPG (prevents core-dumps from leaking the raw password)
* **Wallet**
	- Creation of all Monero wallet types now supported:
		```
		--generate-new-wallet         | [new]
		--generate-from-view-key      | [view]
		--restore-from-seed           | [seed]
		--generate-from-json          | [json]
		--generate-from-spend-key     | [spend]
		--generate-from-device        | [device]
		--generate-from-keys          | [private]
		--generate-from-multisig-keys | [multisig]
		```
* **Debug**
	`monero-bash` now has a debug mode to view ALL the things it's doing in the background. To enable, export this variable before running `monero-bash`:
	```
	export STD_LOG_DEBUG=true
	```
	Or use the `--verbose` flag on package installs/upgrades.
* **Other**
	- Fedora Linux issues fixed
	- Improved documentation
	- Overall UI revamp

## Mining
To quickly start mining on P2Pool, make sure you have all the packages:
* `monero-bash install all`

Configure basic mining settings:
* `monero-bash config`

You can then:
* `monero-bash start all`

Remember, you are using your own node to mine. The blockchain has to be fully synced!

## Configuration
If you already have a custom `monerod.conf` or `monero-wallet-cli.conf`, put them in `.monero-bash/config/` folder and monero-bash will use them. [Refer to this documentation for monero.conf files](https://monerodocs.org/interacting/monero-config-file)

If you have a custom xmrig or p2pool `config.json`, rename them to:
* `xmrig.json`
* `p2pool.json`

and put them in the `.monero-bash/config` folder

[Check here for xmrig configuration](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/config)

P2Pool does not use the xmrig.json wallet!

Please setup P2Pool with `monero-bash config` or edit `.monero-bash/config/monero-bash.conf`
```

## File Structure
Here are all the folders/files created by `monero-bash` after installation:

**INSTALLATION PATH**
```
/usr/local/share/monero-bash/
├─ monero-bash          main script
├─ config               backup config files
├─ gpg                  gpg keys
├─ src                  source code

/usr/local/bin/monero-bash
├─ monero-bash          symlink to main script
```

**HOME FOLDER**
```
/home/user/.monero-bash/
├─ config               config files
├─ wallets              wallet files
├─ .bitmonero           monero blockchain/data folder
```
*note:* the `.bitmonero` folder path can be set anywhere

**SYSTEMD SERVICES**
```
/etc/systemd/system/
├─ monero-bash-monerod.service
├─ monero-bash-p2pool.service
├─ monero-bash-xmrig.service
```

**TEMP FILES**
```
/tmp/
├─ monero-bash.XXXXXXXXXX
├─ monero-bash-hash.XXXXXXXXXX
├─ monero-bash-sig.XXXXXXXXXX
├─ monero-bash-gpg.XXXXXXXXX
├─ monero-bash-service.XXXXXXXXX
```
*note:* monero-bash `/tmp/` folders are deleted after upgrade, and wiped if computer is rebooted. All files created by `monero-bash` have `700/600` permissions or are within folders that have those permissions. This is to prevent any other user from reading the data. After uninstalling monero-bash, all these files are deleted with the exception of `$HOME/.bitmonero` if you picked that as your data directory.

## systemd
monero-bash creates and uses systemd service files to control:
* `monerod`
* `xmrig`
* `p2pool`

If you'd like to directly invoke a program:
* `monero-bash full <daemon/p2pool/xmrig>`

This will launch them in the current terminal

`monerod` and `p2pool` are ran as the $USER, and `xmrig` is ran as `root`. If you'd like to change that, `monero-bash edit <service>` or manually edit `/etc/systemd/system/monero-bash-xmrig.service`. Note that without root, your hashrate may be low.

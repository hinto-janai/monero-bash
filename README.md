monero-bash is a wrapper/manager for:

* [`Monero`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero)
* [`P2Pool`](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool)
* [`XMRig`](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

monero-bash automates these programs into interactive prompts and simple commands

[The latest versions are downloaded using the GitHub API.](https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash/blob/main/src/func/download)

VPN/Tor connections are often rate-limited by the API, if so, monero-bash will find the download link by filtering the HTML of the package's `/releases/latest/` GitHub page.

Hashes for Monero are found here: [`https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt`](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/hashes.txt)

<summary>monero-bash won't let me upgrade?</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I cancel mid-upgrade?</summary>

---

**Yes**

monero-bash uses temporary folders until it's ready to swap binaries:
```
/tmp/monero-bash.XXXXXXXXX
```

If you cancel ***RIGHT*** as the package is being upgraded, monero-bash will swap back the old version, and clean up temporary files.

If you cancel ***AFTER*** the package is installed, but before the local state is updated, monero-bash will force update it and clean up.

You can check your current package versions with
```
monero-bash version
```

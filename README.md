<summary>Can I cancel mid-upgrade?</summary>

---

**Yes**

monero-bash uses temporary folders until it's ready to swap binaries:
```
/tmp/monero-bash.XXXXXXXXX
```

If you cancel ***right*** as the software is being upgraded, monero-bash will swap back your old binaries, and clean up temporary files.

If you cancel ***after*** software is installed, but before the local state is updated, monero-bash will force update it and clean up.

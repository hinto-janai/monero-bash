```
git clone https://github.com/hinto-janaiyo/monero-bash &&
cd monero-bash &&
./monero-bash
```
*note: ALWAYS clone the main branch, the others might contain system-breaking commands* 

it will be added to path so after the initial configuration:
```
monero-bash
```
will work anywhere

to configure, edit the `/monero-bash/config/` file
